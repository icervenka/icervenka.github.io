This pipeline will overlay enhancer information from genomic regions supplied as BED files with RNASeq data to identify correlations between gene and enhancer expression. Pipeline can combine data from several types of experiments such as ATACSeq, GROSeq, CHIPSeq of various histone marks as well as removing ones that fall within coding regions. Requires both polyA depleted and polyA enriched sequencing from a similar set of samples. Created for project where we wanted to identify gene-enhancer pairs that change in skeletal muscle after intense exercise.
