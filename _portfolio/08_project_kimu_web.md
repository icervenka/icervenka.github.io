During my Ph.D. studies at Masaryk University in Brno a scientific exchange program with Karolinska Institutet was created for Ph.D. students to improve mobility and gain expertise in new techniques. As a part of the endavor I was asked to create a webpage that would keep both students and funding agencies up to date with the ongoing events and developments in the program. Source code is available in my [Github] and live version in my [homepage](http://www.igorcervenka.com/kimu/).
