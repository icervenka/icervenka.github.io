Soon after joining the laboratory of Prof. Jorge Ruas, I was kindly asked if I would help with a summary figure for a literature review in progress. It was a perfect opportunity to learn something new about the metabolism field that I had just joined, collaborate with my new colleagues, as well as develop my illustration skills. In the following years the figure was used and re-used as introductory slide in conference presentations and lectures both by our group and other researchers and it still makes me very proud whenever I see it 'in the wild'. You can find the figure in a review [Intercellular: local and systemic actions of skeletal muscle PGC-1s](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043276015000673).
