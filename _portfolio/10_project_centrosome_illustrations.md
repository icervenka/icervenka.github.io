When writing my Ph.D. dissertation thesis, I decided to try my hand at creating all the illustrations and typography and cover myself. It started a long and a bit arduous journey to learn Adobe Indesign and improving my skills in Adobe Illustrator. Overall, even after many years I'm very satisfied with how it all turned out. For those who are interested, the whole thesis including illustrations is available in the [Masaryk University thesis archive](https://is.muni.cz/th/k2g16/cervenka_dt_IS_full.pdf). At that time I was an avid reader of Order of the Stick comics, so I created illustration for my Ph.D. defence presentation in this style.
