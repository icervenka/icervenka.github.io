I have created a series of illustrations for a scientific review [Kynurenines: Tryptophan's metabolites in exercise, inflammation, and mental health](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aaf9794) that I also authored. It was fun and challenging project since I had to convey a lot of information in a very small space, while simultaneously keeping the visuals concise and self-explanatory.
