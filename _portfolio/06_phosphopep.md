I have developed this script and webpage as an easy to use interface to quantitatively analyze phosphorylation status of a particular protein from mass spectrometry data. Originally, we were trying to map a phosphorylation fingerprint of specific kinases on protein Dishevelled. At that time no commercial solution was available so we came up with our own workflow and then created a simple webpage interface so everyone in our group can use it for their own projects. It has served us well and we managed to publish several articles where we used it, nowadays there are commercial solutions available that probably have more robust calculations. You can find the source code in my [Github](https://github.com/icervenka/phosphopep) and a working hosted version in my [homepage](http://www.igorcervenka.com/orbitrap/).
