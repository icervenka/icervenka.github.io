This a webpage for the Molecualar and Cellular Exercise Physiology group at Karolinska Institutet led by Prof. Jorge L. Ruas. We have decided that an externally hosted website should be created that would allow us to have indepth descriptions of our members and projects we are working on, together with a bit more attractive design. Originally, I used this opportunity to learn python MVC framework Flask in which it was originally created. Sfter realising we would need a VPS to run it, which was not really in the budget, I re-coded it in Laravel. It was a fun project, both coming up with design and displaying the information about our laboratory in an interlinked manner. You can find the Laravel source code in my [Github](https://github.com/icervenka/ruaslab-html) and live version at [ruaslab.science](https://www.ruaslab.science/).
