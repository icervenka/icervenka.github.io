After the relative success of the KI-MU program, I was contacted by Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, Karolinska Institutet to create a webpage and design materials for their upcoming conference about Macrophages and Microglia. The design materials included posters, flyers, nametags and abstract book. Webpage included authenticated section with forms to submit abstract information and author lists which then generated abstract book. The design is not exactly top-notch, at that time I was learning gradient meshes in Adobe Illustrator, so I think that reflected on it. At that time I was not aware of PHP frameworks so I coded everything from scratch. It probably was not the most beautiful solution, but it somehow worked. Nowadays I am glad for the availability of frameworks with all sorts of authentication modules and solutions. Source code can be found in my [Github]() and live version in my [homepage](http://www.igorcervenka.com/mm/).
